                This boss is NOT optional, as it is the final fight of the game, appearing immediately upon defeating Radagon of the Golden Order. As with many endgame bosses, Weapons, Incantations, and Spirit Ashes capable of inflicting Black Flame are highly recommended as they deal damage over time based on the boss' maximum HP.
